The expressions we write to conduct these checks use boolean operators and comparison operators. Operators, if you remember from the numbers tutorial, are symbols used to carry out a particular operation. Boolean operators are slightly different to the numerical operators but you will undoubtedly have seen many of them before. Let's look at these new operators in the next two sections."

We know in normal day to day logic that `4 = 4` would be a true statement so why do we need a new double equals sign for this comparison in Python? The short answer is syntax, Python understands specific syntax to give it specific commands and instructions. We have already learned that a single equals sign is used by Python to assign values to variables and using a double equals allows us to differentiate between these commands. It is important not to confuse the two as a single equals sign will not execute a comparison and will likely cause an error in your code. Let's practice a few examples of these comparison operators:"
